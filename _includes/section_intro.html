			I am a Senior Consultant/Lead working at Telstra, having previously worked in Pickles Auctions for 5 years, as well as have worked in AMP in finance and Cochlear in medical devices, retail in Woolworths, giving me a good blend of medium and large scale enterprise experience. Over the years I have developed full stack technical experience and skills in front end web, mobile technologies, and server side and integration solutions across IT domains including Retail, Finance, Banking, Medical, FMCG and Auctions. <br/><br/>
			I enjoy creating great products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases using agile development practices, sprints and thereby gaining insight over agile principles and practices.
